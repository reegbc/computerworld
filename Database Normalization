Reducing the redundancy of database duplication is like when a document such as a Word.doc document is saved in a hard drive in its name, it’s saved name cannot be duplicated. 
If a duplicate copy of the Word.doc document that was saved on the hard drive is requested to be saved in the hard drive, Word.doc requires that the duplicate copy’s name is saved slightly different from the original. 
For example, if the original document’s name is ABC, then the duplicate’s copy’s name can be anything but ABC in the hard drive. 
This procedure is similarly used in addresses, IP addresses, phone numbers, domain names, emails, and other saved document types.
