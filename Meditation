One practice for meditation that is soothing and shows results is music and applying nail polish to my nails. 
Listening to music while applying base coat and favorable colors on my nails free up time for me to think or not think about anything. 
After nail polish is applied to my nails and while letting it dry, I use the time to dry to listen to music while lying down and letting my nails dry. 
Sometimes wearing a mask over my eyes or placing cucumbers on my eyes help with the meditation.
